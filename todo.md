# TalkingCut - Project Roadmap (TODO)

## 1. AI Engine (Python Layer)
- [ ] **WhisperX Integration**: Implement `python/transcribe.py` using `whisperx` for word-level alignment.
- [ ] **Hardware Acceleration**: Configure `device="mps"` (for Apple Silicon) or `device="cuda"` (for Windows/Nvidia) with `compute_type="float16"` to optimize 16GB RAM usage.
- [ ] **Filler Word Detection**: Build a linguistic heuristic script to flag segments as `FILLER` based on common particles (e.g., "uh", "um", "那个", "就是").
- [ ] **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)**: Integrate Silero VAD to identify silent gaps between speech segments longer than 0.5s.
- [ ] **JSON Export**: Ensure the Python script returns a structured JSON containing: `word`, `start`, `end`, `score`, `type`.

## 2. Electron Main Process (Bridge Layer)
- [ ] **IPC Tunneling**: Set up `ipcMain` handlers for `request-transcribe` and `request-export`.
- [ ] **Python Bridge**: Use `child_process.spawn` to manage the Python virtual environment and stream `stdout` progress to the renderer.
- [ ] **FFmpeg Wrapper**: Implement the logic to extract audio from video (pre-transcription) and execute the final cut command generated by `ffmpegService.ts`.
- [ ] **File System**: Manage temporary workspace for processed audio and JSON snapshots.

## 3. Frontend & UX (React Layer)
- [ ] **Timeline View**: Add a zoomable waveform or timeline below the word editor for better visual context.
- [ ] **State Persistence**: Implement an Undo/Redo stack based on `VideoProject` JSON snapshots.
- [ ] **Real-time Sync**: Optimize the `currentTime` logic to ensure the "active word" highlight doesn't lag during high-resolution video playback.
- [ ] **Segment Search**: Add a search bar to find and batch-delete specific words or phrases.
- [ ] **Export Preview**: Show a "virtual preview" of the cut video (skipping deleted segments during playback) before actually rendering.

## 4. Video Engineering (FFmpeg Layer)
- [ ] **Lossless Cutting**: Test `concat demuxer` vs `filter_complex` to find the best balance between frame accuracy and speed.
- [ ] **Audio Crossfades**: Add a tiny 20ms crossfade between cuts to prevent "audio pops" at clip transitions.
- [ ] **Padding Logic**: Refine the breathing room logic to ensure it doesn't overlap with subsequent kept segments.

## 5. Deployment & Optimization
- [ ] **Binary Packaging**: Bundle FFmpeg and a portable Python environment (using PyInstaller or conda-pack) within the Electron app.
- [ ] **Model Downloader**: Create a UI flow for users to download Whisper model weights (Tiny/Base/Large) on first launch.
- [ ] **Memory Monitoring**: Add a guardrail to warn users if the `Large` model exceeds available RAM.
